# STARFISH

Useful git commands:

git pull - pulls the most recent edits for the codes onto your personal branch, highly recommend doing this before doing any coding to be on the safe side.

git status - shows you which files you've updated or added to your local branch. Great for knowing what you should commit/push.

git add - this is how you add stuff to your commit.

git commit -m "custom message here" - acts as a save point to your code. Should do this whenever you make an edit to your code. I personally use this 5-6 times a day when I work on code. Also you should leave a message for what you did here.

git push - pushes your files to the main branch. Do this when you are done with your code. i.e. you finish debugging it and it's ready for others to use.

nominal git command inputs

git add . # the . adds all changed files to be staged for commit. can also enter specific files, this just makes it faster

git commit -m"<commit_message>" # commits all added files. -m attaches the message you want to the commit in the terminal. if you don't add a commit message, a text file will pop up and have you type out a message, so this just simplifies that a bit

git push # pushes all committed changes to github
